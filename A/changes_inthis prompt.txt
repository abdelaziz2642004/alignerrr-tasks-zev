  Summary

  New --stats Flag

  Added a --stats flag that displays detailed feedback statistics using Rich tables:

  1. Overall Statistics: Total feedback count, success/failure rates, breakdown of success/failed/skipped
  2. Most Used Commands: Table showing the top 5 most frequently used commands with their usage count, success/failure counts, and success rate (color-coded: green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, red <40%)
  3. Commands with Most Failures: Table showing commands that failed most often, with failure count, total uses, and failure rate
  4. Recent Failures: List of the 5 most recent failed commands with their associated notes

  New Methods in CommandHistory

  - get_aggregated_stats(): Returns detailed statistics including most used commands, highest failures, and recent failures with notes
  - get_anonymized_export_stats(): Returns statistics suitable for export without revealing actual commands or queries - only metadata like total count, unique commands, success rates, and averages
