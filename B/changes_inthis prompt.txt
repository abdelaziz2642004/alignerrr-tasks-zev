  Usage:

  # When a workflow is interrupted, it shows:
  # "Workflow state saved. Resume with: zev --resume"

  # To resume incomplete workflows:
  zev --resume

  # Shows a table of incomplete workflows with:
  # - Workflow ID
  # - Name
  # - Progress (e.g., "2/5 (1 failed)")
  # - Original query
  # - Last updated time

  # Resume options:
  # - Run remaining steps sequentially
  # - Step through interactively
  # - Retry failed step(s) first
  # - Discard workflow and cancel
  # - Cancel (keep saved state)
