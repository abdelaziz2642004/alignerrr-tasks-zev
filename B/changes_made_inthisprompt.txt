● The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the test coverage:

  Test Coverage Summary

  Valid Commands Tested (all correctly accepted):

  - Basic commands: ls -la, git status, echo "hello"
  - Complex pipes/redirects: cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3, cmd 2>&1 | tee log
  - Control flow: if/then/fi, for/do/done, while/do/done, case/esac
  - Command substitution: $(...), backticks, nested substitution
  - Escaped characters: \", \ , \$, escaped quotes
  - Heredocs: <<EOF, <<<, <<-EOF
  - Process substitution: <(cmd), >(cmd)
  - Real-world commands: find -exec, docker run, curl | jq
  - Brace expansion: {1..10}, {a,b,c}
  - Subshells and groups: (cmd), { cmd; }

  Invalid Commands Tested (all correctly rejected):

  - Unclosed quotes: Single, double, and backticks with position info
  - Trailing operators: |, &&, ||, >, >>
  - Leading operators: |, &&, ||, ;
  - Unbalanced delimiters: (), {}, [], $()
  - Control flow: Unclosed if, for, while, case
  - Empty commands: Empty string, whitespace-only
  - Malformed structure: = value (missing variable name)

  The validator correctly handles complex shell syntax without being overly restrictive, and provides detailed,
  actionable error messages with position information and suggestions for fixing issues.
